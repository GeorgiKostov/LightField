# LightField
Lightfield is an audio visualization, meant to be used with a normal home projector and a fog machine. There are around 20 animations,
some of which move depending on the audio frequency. By default they are randomized every few seconds. You can also use different
buttons on the keyboard to control individual animations, restart or turn off the randomizer. Here are the shortcuts (needs Ui yeah >():
